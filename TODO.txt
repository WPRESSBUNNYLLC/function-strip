   make sure to recurse on if a function is invokable (); - do this at the end of each function... make sure the function can be invoked beforehand with a parameter
   add other languages (below iterate_through_file_text) also add languages as a configuration property to skip over files
   make sure to use regular expressions instead of many !== in some files
   possibly use a library for checking syntax errors or some compiler and skip file if error
   make sure to add if a regular name in arrow function in case there are no parameters - const wow = jkj => { } <-- condition to avoid counting brackets
   add additional checks for regular expressions on the reg call in index.js
   just figure out the cases for tags 
   add inside functions as an array to the outermost function using a non returned recursive call - if adding a few other data structures... can do the same thing and create an object or array pointer {a{b{c}}}
   correct beginning and end of regular and arrow function 
   before and after for error
   replace all recursive functions with while loops .. 1 per with an if else if to make up for the single recursive statements
   add a ignore comments in parameter string and function attribute

   1. template 
   2. regex 
   3. regular beginning
   4. regular body
   5. arrow beginning 
   6. arrow body 

   done
