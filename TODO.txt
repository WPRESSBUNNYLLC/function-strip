take equals into consideration
possibly get rid of charAt and split across
find a compiler that reutrns errors to skip over bad files 
get enclosed and invoked in a different way
add class functions
add the other function types in javascript 
update_function_and_update_data.data instead of data_ -- get rid of copies after
possibly add data_index and line_number to data.js

just create a token set and iterate through that and build values recursively... then push recursively into an array to format for user.
key word works for functions but going to get everything else
